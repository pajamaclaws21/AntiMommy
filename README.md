# Anti-Mommy (NEW!)
A little bit of code I wrote in Snap! to undo the effects of the Mommy Virus after pressing CTRL-X in JoeCoolDoo's MS-DOS.
This repository contains:
- the project summary (download to view properly)
- the .xml file of the project (same, download to use)

Please note that to use this anti-virus properly, you need to have JS extensions enabled and need to use the "ics" function.
The command that activates this antiviral program is "antiv".
